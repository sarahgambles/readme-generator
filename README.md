  #### Installation 
  Start by installing Inquirer. Then create the questions in the correct documentation to receive the input. Then create another JavaScript file and connect the two using modules.exports. Write the functions in the second file to call and generate the README file. Run the app using Terminal.  
  #### Usage 
  Keep the creation simple but use Markdown features to make it more stylized and easier to read.  
  #### Contributing 
  Feel free to use the code, as long as you reference it in your work.  
  #### Tests 
  Use the generator to create README files of your own. Switch types in the index.js file to create different types of responses.
